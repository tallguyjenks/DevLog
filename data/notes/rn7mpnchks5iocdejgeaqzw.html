<blockquote>
<p>The region where global variables (<em>variables declared outside any function</em>) as well as static local variables (<em>variables declared inside functions starting with the keyword "static"</em>) are allocated. The name "static" comes from these variables not changing (<em>static means not changing</em>); they are allocated once and last for the duration of a program's execution, their addresses staying the same.</p>

<h2 id="the-stack"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#the-stack"></a>The Stack</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The region where a function's local variables are allocated <u>during a function call</u>. A function call adds local variables to the stack, and a return removes them, like adding and removing dishes from a pile; hence the term "<em>stack</em>." Because this memory is automatically allocated and deallocated, it is also called <strong>automatic memory</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-heap"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#the-heap"></a>The Heap</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The region where the "<em>new</em>" operator allocates memory, and where the "<em>delete</em>" operator deallocates memory. The region is also called <strong>free store</strong>.</p>
