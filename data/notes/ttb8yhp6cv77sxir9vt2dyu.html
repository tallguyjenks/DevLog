<p>This file is sourced upon system login so normally it should only be executed once upon a successful login into the system.</p>
<p>These profile files <code>.[zx]profile</code> can also just point to where you want the real file content to be such as </p>
<p><code>$HOME/.xprofile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>.config/x11/xprofile
</code></pre>
<p>because this file is run once on system login it should also be the trigger to start the graphical environment in the tty.</p>
