<p>The same as <a href="/DevLog/notes/ahs5n2rskoyw7pwbti5gm3v">T-SQL Left Join</a> except the left side has records removed from is where are are <code>NULL</code>'s in the right side.</p>
<p>So this is saying when joining Women to Men on <code>MARRIAGE_ID</code> Where <code>MARRIAGE_ID IS NULL</code> means you will only see Married Men Returned. No Single Men and no Women at all.</p>
