<blockquote>
<p>“Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, this can be expressed as “Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, the sub-class “Platypus”, of the base class “Mammals”, would have the exception that these mammals lay eggs. The LSP, tell us that it would create a function called “give_birth”, this function will have different behavior for the sub-class Platypus and the sub-class Dog. Therefore, we should have had a more abstract base class than Mammals that accommodate this.</p>
<p>If this sounds very confusing, do not worry, the application of this latter aspect of the LSP is rarely fully implemented, and it rarely leaves the theoretical textbooks.</p>
