<ul>
<li>used the <a href="/DevLog/notes/avcqivhqynd9idgmva251t8">Pyinstaller</a> package to make a python script into a <code>.exe</code> file</li>
<li>tried to use both <a href="/DevLog/notes/712kg37zax3hamzpm1ypnzk">Markdown</a> and <a href="/DevLog/notes/g8jz1e99nnpbzc83mxv264r">HTML</a> links to call the file and have it executed but none of these options worked.</li>
<li>In the end what satisfied me was having a link to a <a href="/DevLog/notes/j13rvob3zgyz8xz8z7ul1z5">Jupyter</a> notebook that then opens up and can contain both markdown documentation and the code to be executed in steps or batches.</li>
