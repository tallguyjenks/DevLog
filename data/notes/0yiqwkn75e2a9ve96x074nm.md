Instead of having somewhere to look for data or processes, they ask other developers where something is. This is a signal that there needs to be something that all the developers can use to search for their answers first instead of bothering other people about something that a catalog could answer."

## What Do I Put in a Microservice Catalog?

Let’s summarize some of the use cases for a microservice catalog:

- A single website that can display information for the kind of service or application you deploy.
- Links to the source code and developer documentation.
- Links and endpoint links for API use cases.
- Links to example usages.
- Information and links on the production system.
- Statistics on the performance of the production system.
- Links to the build system that pushes those services or applications to production.
- Anything else that anyone on that team may find helpful for using your services.
