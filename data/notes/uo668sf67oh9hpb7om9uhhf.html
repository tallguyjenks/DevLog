<ul>
<li>First step in refactoring is to ensure that there is a solid set of tests for the section of code to ensure that functionality is not altered</li>
<li>Immediately compile/run the code after a change along with the test quite to check for unintended changes</li>
<li>Incrementally save and commit to VCS to easily return to prior state, squash merge later for the actual merge of the refactoring into <a href="/DevLog/notes/jak8s12bepa7jt6n3pem8ro">Git</a></li>
<li>Even if the result of a refactor is more loops and more loop iterations and what "appears" to be more inefficient code
<ul>
<li>sometimes the increased inefficiency is negligible or justifiably worth it for cleaner, simpler, more legible code.</li>
<li>If performance takes a big hit then it may warrant performance tuning after the refactor to try and speed it back up or even a revert of the refactor</li>
</ul>
</li>
