<ul>
<li>Databases can live in a single <code>.db</code> file</li>
<li>queries have to end with a <code>;</code></li>
<li>The syntax is similar to other SQL's but it of course has it differences and functionalities that it lacks</li>
<li>Cant seem to find a way to do a string split cross apply with SQLite to take a single column with a string of values comma separated to split them then cross apply them to list and then filter/aggregate them.
<ul>
<li>This is making me rely more of more tables in the relational model v.s. robust functions.</li>

<li>looked at clojure a little bit but immediately decided against looking into it further since apparently it's meant to run on a JVM or java Virtual Machine.</li>
<li>I have no intention of looking into Java right now so that was a quick foray into the weird looking syntax of Clojure. maybe something like lisp/elisp for emacs will be more interesting and applicable for me.</li>

<li>markdown markdown hyperlinks when separated by declaration and definition, they can be re-used!</li>
</ul>
<pre class="language-markdown"><code class="language-markdown"><span class="token url">[<span class="token content">link text</span>][<span class="token variable">1</span>]</span>

<span class="token url-reference url"><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token variable">1</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> https://www.bryanjenks.dev</span>

<span class="token url">[<span class="token content">but I can also re-use the link here!</span>][<span class="token variable">1</span>]</span>

And this will work all throughout a markdown document
