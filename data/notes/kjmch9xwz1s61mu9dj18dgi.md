  Been playing around with other means of getting work done with ADHD and task warrior helped me get a lot more done that things like trello or taskell were but still i was procrastinating. now im using time blocking on icalendar `and explain it and why and how` could also use calcurse if you're one of the linux peeps or any calendar app. i like the ease of using icalendar. and siri for reminders and scheduling tasks. ive gotten things done in the first week that i was sitting on for months.
