- used the [[s.l.python.libs.pyinstaller]] package to make a python script into a `.exe` file
- tried to use both [[s.m.markdown]] and [[s.m.html]] links to call the file and have it executed but none of these options worked.
- In the end what satisfied me was having a link to a [[s.l.python.tools.jupyter]] notebook that then opens up and can contain both markdown documentation and the code to be executed in steps or batches.
