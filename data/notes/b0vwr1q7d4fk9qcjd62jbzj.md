### Tuple

```python
# can be created just by assigning values encapsulated in parens
# or for a single value leaving a trailing comma

a = (1, 2, 3, 4)
# or
b = ('a',)
# or
c = 1, 2, 3, 4,

# tuples are immutable, they are smaller in memory than lists, have less methods available to them, and are faster that lists.

survey = (27, "vietnam", True)
age, country, knows_python = survey # this works
print(age)
print(country)
print(knows_python)
```
