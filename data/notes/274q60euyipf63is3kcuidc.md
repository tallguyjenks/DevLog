#### Inputs

- [x] [[r.+.2021.12.15.python-typing-type-hints-and-annotations]]
- [[r.(.python-custom-exceptions]]

#### Notes

Today i worked a decent amount with [[s.l.python.libs.pyyaml]] and moving all authentication variables and values to a single [[s.df.yaml]] data file stored in the users local appdata folder

Learned that matches from the [[s.l.python.libs.re]] module can be converted to booleans for if statements by wrapping the whole function in a `bool()`

also started playing a little more with custom exceptions messages
