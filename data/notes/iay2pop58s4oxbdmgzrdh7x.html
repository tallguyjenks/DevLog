<p>Nearly done with the bulk of my SQL Server financial system! i spent the entire day literally almost the entire day non stop coding out all the automations, tables, joins, constrains, jobs, everything to make this system a well oiled machine for personal finance! a few more odds and ends to do but im excited for it to all be automated and trace-able wil double entry accounting!</p>
<p>even going to have it generate a an email with an HTML table in the body with all transaction line items for my partner's monthly invoice for our joint finances. </p>
