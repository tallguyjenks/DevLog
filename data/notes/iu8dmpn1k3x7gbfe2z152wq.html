<ul>
<li>like an array method this will create a <em>Box</em> and put all your changes inside of it and shove that <em>box</em> in the corner of the room and give you a clean working tree.</li>
<li>The <em>box</em> is now portable and you can switch to another branch and open the <em>box</em> there and take out all of the changes.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">git</span> stash pop
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>This opens the <em>box</em> and applies all those stashed changes to the current working tree.</li>
<li>This is very useful for the situations where maybe you made a bunch of changes and you forgot to make a new branch and you're still on <code>master</code>/<code>main</code> and you want to move all those changes to the actual feature branch.</li>
</ul>
