<p><code>A</code>ddress</p>
<p>used to resolve a host name to an IPv4 address.
This is the most common type of record in a DNS zone.
In a lot of infrastructures, there will be an A record for every client on the network, plus servers, printers, and other connected devices.
However, in some environments, client workstations will not be listed as A recordsâ€”only servers, printers, and other shared resources.</p>
