```python
# Integer whole numbers
a = 496
print(type(a)) # int for integer

# Float for floating point number
a = 496
print(type(a)) # float

# Complex Numbers (in math i is used for imaginary numbers, in programming and python it is 'j')
a = 496 - 6.1j #the j is the complex part
print(type(a)) # complex
print(a.real) # view the real part of the number
print(a.imag) # view the imaginary part of the number
```
