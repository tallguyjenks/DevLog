### Dereferencing a Pointer

> Prepending `*` to a pointer variable's name in an expression gets the data to which the variable points, as in `*myPtr1`, an act known as **dereferencing** a pointer variable. `*` is the dereference operator that allows the program to access the value pointed to by the pointer using the form:

```cpp
*myInt;
```
