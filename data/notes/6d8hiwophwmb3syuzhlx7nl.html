<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>delete</strong> operator does the opposite of the new operator. The statement <code>delete pointerVariable</code>; deallocates a memory block pointed to by pointerVariable, which must have been previously allocated by new. If pointerVariable is null, delete has no effect.</p>
