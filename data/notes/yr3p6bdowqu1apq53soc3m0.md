`A`ddress

used to resolve a host name to an IPv4 address. 
This is the most common type of record in a DNS zone. 
In a lot of infrastructures, there will be an A record for every client on the network, plus servers, printers, and other connected devices. 
However, in some environments, client workstations will not be listed as A recordsâ€”only servers, printers, and other shared resources.
