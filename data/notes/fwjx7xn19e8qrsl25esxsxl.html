<p><a href="/DevLog/notes/fwjx7xn19e8qrsl25esxsxl">Link Aggregation</a> or <a href="/DevLog/notes/lgl3co3ibveuv4ejvn2yso6">LACP</a> is the combining two or more separate cabled links into a single logical channel, referred to as an <code>EtherChannel</code>
From the host end, this can also be called <code>NIC teaming</code>; at the switch end, it can be called <code>port aggregation</code></p>
<p>The term bonding is also widely substituted for aggregation.
For example, a single network adapter and cable segment might support 1 Gbps;
bonding this with another adapter and cable segment gives a link of 2 Gbps.</p>
