- IP addressing conventions
  - 1st Network IP Address --> Default Gateway i.e. Router
  - Try to use IP Addresses in sequential order
  - Try to separate servers from clients
    - Like `197.156.4.10` to `197.154.4.19` for servers
    - and `197.156.4.200` to `197.156.4.254` for clients
  - Document these things for future tech's
