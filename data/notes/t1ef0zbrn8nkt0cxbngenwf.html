<blockquote>
<p>“Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstraction. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions”</p>
</blockquote>
<p> So, that abstractions (e.g., the interface, as seen above) should not be dependent on low-level methods but both should depend on a third interface.
<br>
To better explain this concept, I prefer to think of a sort of information flow.
<br>
Imagine that you have a program that takes in input a specific set of info (a file, a format, etc) and you wrote a script to process it.
<br>
What would happen if that info were subject to changes?
<br>
You would have to rewrite your script and adjust the new format. Losing the retro compatibility with the older files.
<br>
However, you could solve this by creating a third abstraction that takes the info as input and passes it to the others.
This is basically what an API is also, used for.</p>
