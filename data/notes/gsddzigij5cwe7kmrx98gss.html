<p>Did a lot of research and testing of virtual machines in <a href="/DevLog/notes/scila6vssybq401kzsq1d5b">Proxmox</a> trying to see what i can get set up. Looking at trying to get <a href="/DevLog/notes/2sgfr1r4i6jbwoma8b84913">TrueNAS</a> setup on <a href="/DevLog/notes/82umkyemhjtdlkjgew0a2km">Fafnir</a> so i can use that as the storage volume for things because at this point stuff is acting weird and im just trying to get something working and operational lol. </p>
<p>Also got the rest of the unifi gear headed here so i can work on the actual network deployment and use my switch and the dream machine pro to manage the network at a higher level.</p>
<p>Decided i felt like learning more about <a href="/DevLog/notes/joyevz9532y0sejj98qasb7">Postgres</a> today via <a href="/DevLog/notes/55ardlvgz9rynhcihd1wyqj">Postgres Can Do That</a></p>
<p>Finishing Work KT story on <a href="/DevLog/notes/joyevz9532y0sejj98qasb7">Postgres</a> by reviewing <a href="/DevLog/notes/kyeu3h5pym90eziek8pjn4n">Sql_for_data_analytics_perform_fast_and_efficient</a></p>
