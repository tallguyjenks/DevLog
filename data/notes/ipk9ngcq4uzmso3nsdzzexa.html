<p>"The vertical tab is like the horizontal tab defined to reduce the amount of work for creating layouts, and also reduce the amount of storage space for formatted text pages. The VT control code is used to jump to the next marked line."
<br>
In the world of typewriters, a vertical tab typically moved a distance of 6 lines, the same way a horizontal tab would typically move a distance of 8 spaces. In old printers, the vertical tab would also speed up vertical movement by indicating a jump to the next spot on a special tab belt, which was helpful for aligning content on forms.</p>
