- Patch panel is solely used for organization
- Patch panels typically are used for
  - Network jack cabling that will never be changed
  - Running Hard lines to various locations
  - organizing cable output locations into the patch panel which goes into the router
    - This way when the patch cable between the patch panel and switch wears out its not the house wiring that is getting worn its the disposable gear.
- Patch panel cables that get ran through your house are not stranded cables rather they are solid core cables and are not meant to be handled often
- Patch panel cabling is useful for terminating wire ends of house cabling into the panel which turns into jacks to connect to the switch/router
