There is a cli client that can access SQL Server from the cli and it works on all platforms allowing for queries to be ran and for output to be sent to the cli.

## Potential use cases

- Cronjobs to routinely run scripts that insert data at regular intervals or on certain system events
- join with other scripts and tools like [[cli.cmd.ledger-cli]], [[s.l.bash]], [[cli.cmd.fzf]], etc to make for a robust workflow to manage finances

## Installation

```bash
pip install mssql-cli
```
