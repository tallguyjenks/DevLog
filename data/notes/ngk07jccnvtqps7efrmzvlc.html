<blockquote>
<p>Floating-point numbers should not be compared using <code>==</code>. Ex: Avoid float1 <code>==</code> float2.
.
Reason: Some floating-point numbers cannot be exactly represented in the limited available memory bits like 64 bits. Floating-point numbers expected to be equal may be close but not exactly equal.
.
Floating-point numbers should be compared for <em>"close enough"</em> rather than exact equality.
Ex: If <code>( x - y ) &#x3C; 0.0001</code>, x and y are deemed equal.
Because the difference may be negative, the absolute value is used: <code>fabs(x - y) &#x3C; 0.0001</code>.
.
The difference threshold indicating that floating-point numbers are equal is often called the <code>epsilon</code>. Epsilon's value depends on the program's expected values, but 0.0001 is common.</p>
