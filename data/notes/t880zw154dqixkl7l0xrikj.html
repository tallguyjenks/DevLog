<p>To dynamically resize a vector while program is executing and size is not known during compile time.</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code class="language-cpp">vctr<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">resize</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>N<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>  <span class="token comment">// Allocates N elements for vector vctr.</span>
</code></pre>
<p>resize is now adding new slots on top of existing elements, rather it just states that <em>"THIS is how many elements are in this vector"</em>. If the resize value is smaller than the vectors current size, all elements in indexes larger than <code>N</code> are destroyed and <code>N</code> is now the size of the vector.</p>
