## Syntax

In markdown you can actually use [[LaTeX|s.m.latex]] Math equations. This is through a [[s.l.javascript]] Library called [MathJaX](https://www.mathjax.org/). 

Mathjax is also similar to eqn in [[Groff|s.m.groff]].

The basic syntax of LaTeX Math is 

`$inline equation$`

`$\sum\frac{\pi}{\sigma}$`

$\sum\frac{\pi}{\sigma}$

`$$Centered Equations$$`

`$$\sum\frac{\pi}{\sigma}$$`

$\sum\frac{\pi}{\sigma}$

as for the specifics of what equations you're putting into them that's up to you
