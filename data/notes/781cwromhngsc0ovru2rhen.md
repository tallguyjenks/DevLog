- setting up devlog onto github pages with publish, using the desktop app, github cron job for auto push sync, and just figuring out the whole shenanigans.
- I finished getting my [[cli.cmd.git]] sync [[s.l.powershell]] script setup on windows task scheduler so now i have a live sync of my DevLog using the desktop app and windows!
  - Clunky but it will do

- Network Topologies
  - Star
    - The most common topology such as around a router or WAP
    - ![image.png](assets/images/image_1625727190861_0.png)
  - Bus
    - Terminators at either end of the connection which is a single cable and other devices tap into this cable for connectivity.
    - should the cable get cut this can cause a loss of connectivity as well as a lot of excess noise

  - Ring
    - rare, if only 1 ring in 1 direction, a cut cable renders the topology useless, dual ring can help prevent this but this is not commonly used anymore

  - Mesh
    - Not as common, used to connect every device directly to ever other device. LOTS of cables used
