> If you have a column that represents the datetime of when a record was loaded, there is no reason for you to write CURRENT_TIMESTAMP over and over when you insert data into that table.
> Instead, when you create the table, specify that columnâ€™s default value of GETDATE. You can do it programmatically or in the table designer.
> Below is an example of a data warehouse staging table template containing a primary key and standard audit columns. As you can see, each audit column has been assigned a default value there by reducing your insert statement by six lines.
> Considering you will be writing thousands of procs over your career, the time saved from not having to write six lines is significant.
