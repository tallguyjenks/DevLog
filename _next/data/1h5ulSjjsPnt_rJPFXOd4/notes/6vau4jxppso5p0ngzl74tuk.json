These names should be considered reserved, and should only be used for their intended purpose. These are all the special methods:</p>\n<p><code>setup</code>: This method allows to provide attributes or anything else that is used by tests. By convention, it is called once before every test method in the class is executed. If lots of tests are using some sample data, it can be defined once here instead of having it referenced over and over in every single test method.</p>\n<p><code>teardown</code>: This method allows to perform any cleanup actions needed by tests. Just like the setup method, it gets called once, but after every test method in the class is executed. For example, if a test is always leaving behind artifacts like files that shouldn’t be present, this special method could remove them, so that the next test doesn’t have a polluted environment.</p>\n<p><code>setupclass</code>: Similar to setup, but instead of running before every test is executed it runs once before starting a test in a class.</p>\n<p><code>teardownclass</code>: This method runs once after all tests in the class have been executed.</p>\n<p>If you are wondering why <code>__init__</code> is not mentioned in this list, it is because you should not have one for test classes. Historically, <code>unittest.TestCase</code> (Python’s standard library for testing) didn’t have them, and it relied on setup and teardown class methods, and tools like pytest skips collection of test classes if it detects an <code>__init__</code> method in them.</p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/DevLog/notes/hud6uw8wwi8ndecwedow0w4\">10 (DevLog)</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"root","title":"root","desc":"","updated":1641013093667,"created":1595961348801,"stub":false,"custom":{"stub":false,"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"DevLog"},"contentHash":"b0b26527a2962dbb8bd5fb9a53ad702f","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":["rzqe5mjn3q2zfscw1roxr20","Bl9NeJmftBQJyJA3X4a6u","inm1S24v2GcN3Quf7gzDb","fmx7cfcdzale0ezna61yq5z","q6tr8q7gahfijix2ktlhcu3","yah6spesmpstech2ue2k3lq","6pxwlugphnw6vm4t8kn0j5p","i17wi8y2hgivywe08h6q6it","1st35wikvph2aew8aana21u","mijr0wvj3qz0mt9pv9xo1jv","qaf8v120h0ffvbowysjxw50","sh4851li2rsrhx47wwsirgv","fwqjigvqyfxiyl3pbpjvgdw","pxdvvln974xhe8w0alh0hoy","n6yddb1smrac5ll3l1y6wbd","g5dllyqoqkenoiz3opalzu6","kbwt8ucy0yh6bo8fl0kv9iw","beykavbe22agsufmm03hu0c","2uvuqa3c15o5r4j7sqadqvr","yr6gzhx0bhzyec6f52y66vf","4no90tcdswtuwmjm0bxnetx"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nThe hyperfixated rabbit hole diving knowledge base that is my brain looking at technology.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"sterkere","visibility":"private"},{"fsPath":"Norsk","visibility":"private"},{"fsPath":"DevLog"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"log","name":"daily","dateFormat":"yyyy.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"yyyy.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"todoIntegration":true,"name":"task","dateFormat":"yyyy.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"wip","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.95.1","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":false,"templateHierarchy":"template","enableSmartRefs":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"theme":"custom","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"assetsPrefix":"/DevLog","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"enableSiteLastModified":true,"siteRootDir":"docs","siteUrl":"https://{GITHUB_USERNAME}.github.io","enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["DevLog"]},"writeStubs":false,"seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"Personal knowledge space"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enablePrettyLinks":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
