- Database Engine Tuning Advisor
  - Optimizes performance of SQL Server
  - Does this by analyzing the commands it sees being sent to SQL Server and figuring out the best place to put indexes and that sort of thing
  - Typically you complete a trace using Profiler (above) then feed it into the Tuning Advisor
