`V`irtual `L`ocal `A`rea `N`etwork

- VLAN's for various utility purposes
  - `"...it is common practice to isolate server-to-server traffic from client-server traffic and to isolate administration/management traffic (channels used for inbound management of appliances and servers). Another standard configuration option is to create a "null" VLAN that is non-routable to the rest of the network. This VLAN is used for any physical ports that do not have authorized connected equipment."`
